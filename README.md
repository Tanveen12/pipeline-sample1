# Project: pipeline-sample

## Goal

This project is here to demonstrate various topics covered in SENG8050.  There
are many branches in this project and each of them will cover a different topic.


## Getting started

### Requirements

You will need NPM and Node installed on your local machine. It is highly
recommended that you use a environment manager. The environment manager will
prevent pollution of your local system. I highly recommend [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
Read about the details on the NVM project page.

### Quick Start

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development environment:

```bash
npm start
```

## Tests

Run tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```
